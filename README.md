This is a small soap bot :)

## Installation

1. create a file named token.txt with your discord bot token inside
1. Install "discord", "cleaninty", "fusepy" and "pyctr" via pip
1. Create a folder named donors, and put donors generated by cleaninty inside(you should probably name them properly)
+ THESE DONORS HAVE TO BE FIXED! do not put freshly obtained donors in there, instead fix them with this for example :)
1. Create a file named "serialblacklist.txt, and put blacklisted serials inside(or not). (There shouldnt be blacklisted serials when you pull serial from sticker)
1. Replace token here in the last line with the discord token of the bot, I obviously wont share mine
1. Set up cleaninty with cleaninty ctr SetupConstants

## Usage
command line: `python discordbot.py` \
discord: `-soap --help` \
-logs are sent to console \
-new donors are initialized on script launch
