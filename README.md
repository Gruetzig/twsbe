This is a small soap bot :)

## Installation

1. Install "discord", "cleaninty" and "ninfs" via pip. Make sure these modules are in the path! (I did sudo pip install but theres probably a much easier way)
2. Create a folder named donors, and put donors generated by cleaninty inside(you should probably name them properly)
3. Create a file named "serialblacklist.txt, and put blacklisted serials inside(or not). (There shouldnt be blacklisted serials when you pull serial from sticker)
4. Replace token here in the last line with the discord token of the bot, I obviously wont share mine


## Usage

-soap <link to essential file download(like discordapp.com)> <serial with checkdigit>

-errors are sent to console 

-new donors are initialized on script launch
